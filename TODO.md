# Voice Agent - TODO Tracker

Covers: `sam-backend` (backend + agent) and `ai-employees-app` (frontend)
Last updated: 2026-03-31 (session 11 — agent settings RLS fix, calendar phone/email fields, outbound call UI + trunk architecture fix)

---

## ✅ Done

### Backend
- [x] FastAPI app with CORS, health check, JWT auth (Supabase)
- [x] `POST /calls/initiate` — creates LiveKit room, call record, returns token
- [x] `GET /calls`, `GET /calls/{id}`, `GET /calls/{id}/transcript`, `GET /calls/{id}/summary`, `GET /calls/{id}/recording`
- [x] `PUT /calls/{id}/status`
- [x] Settings router — 10 feature flag toggles, global on/off, audit log
- [x] Communication settings CRUD (call/email/SMS scripts stored, not sent)
- [x] Forwarding contacts + rules CRUD
- [x] Analytics — summary metrics, call volume trends, call distribution
- [x] LiveKit service — room creation, token generation (user + agent), room deletion
- [x] `USE_LIVEKIT_AGENT` feature flag switch in `/calls/initiate`
- [x] Legacy voice agent worker (`backend/worker/voice_agent.py`) — GPT-4o Realtime, writes transcripts + summaries

### Agent (`agent/agent.py`)
- [x] LiveKit Agents pattern — auto-dispatched by LiveKit Cloud
- [x] Reads participant metadata (business_id, location_id, call_id)
- [x] Builds system prompt from Supabase: business name, locations, global settings, brand voice, staff list
- [x] System prompt includes full business details: type, phone, email, address, website, payment methods, policies, service area
- [x] System prompt includes business hours from `business_hours` table
- [x] System prompt includes services list upfront (no tool call needed for basic "what do you offer?")
- [x] System prompt includes knowledge base text entries from `knowledge_base` table
- [x] **`get_services`** tool — lists active services with duration + price
- [x] **`get_staff_for_service`** tool — staff at a location who can perform a service (reads `user_services`, `user_locations`, `profiles`)
- [x] **`get_available_slots`** tool — computes free slots from `user_availability`, `user_availability_overrides`, existing `appointments`
- [x] **`book_appointment`** tool — inserts into `appointments` table, links `call_id` in notes, stores `client_phone` + `client_email` in dedicated columns
- [x] **`find_appointments`** tool — finds upcoming appointments by client name (ilike search)
- [x] **`update_appointment`** tool — reschedules by ref + client_name; availability check; sends reschedule emails to customer + staff
- [x] **`cancel_appointment`** tool — cancels by ref + client_name; sends cancellation emails to customer + staff
- [x] Preloads locations, services, staff + user_service_ids at call start (no per-tool DB round trips for lookups)
- [x] Post-call: `conversation_item_added` event captures all transcript turns in memory
- [x] Post-call: bulk-saves transcript utterances to `transcripts` table on call end
- [x] Post-call: updates call record — `status=completed`, `ended_at`, `duration_seconds`
- [x] Post-call: GPT-4o chat generates JSON summary → saved to `call_summaries` with `key_topics`, `insights`
- [x] Post-call: updates `calls.sentiment` from summary result

### Bugs Fixed (session 9)
- [x] SIP dispatch rule had `inbound_numbers=[phone_number]` causing calls to ring forever without agent pickup — removed, trunk `numbers` filter is sufficient
- [x] SIP calls created no `calls` DB row — agent now auto-creates the record at session start (status=`active`, caller_phone from SIP attrs)
- [x] `GET /calls` and analytics returned 0 rows — `supabase` anon client has no user JWT set, RLS blocks all reads; switched to `supabase_admin` (auth still enforced via `Depends(get_current_user)` + `business_id` filter)
- [x] Call transcript showed all bubbles as "Customer" — frontend used `msg.role`/`msg.content` but backend sends `msg.speaker`/`msg.text`; fixed type + rendering in `CallRecordings.tsx`

### Bugs Fixed (session 10)
- [x] `calls` INSERT failed with FK violation on `location_id` — dispatch rules had stale `location_id` (`9174e86b...`) deleted from `locations` table; `_create_dispatch_rule` now only stores `business_id` in attributes; agent Source 3 no longer reads `location_id` from SIP attributes
- [x] Location missing from agent greeting — `prompt_builder.py` now falls back to `locations[0]` when `location_id` is None
- [x] Fallback call record creation at finalization — if initial INSERT fails (transient error), retried just before saving transcript
- [x] SIP phone number not E.164 — `_normalize_phone_e164()` strips non-digits and prepends `+1` for North American numbers
- [x] `gmail_tokens.google_email` was empty — manually fixed in DB; emails now send correctly

### Frontend — Outbound Calls (session 11)
- [x] `OutboundCallDialog.tsx` — call type selector (Reminder / Feedback / Follow-up / General)
- [x] Appointment list auto-filters by call type (upcoming vs past) using `useAppointments`
- [x] Auto-fills client phone from appointment; falls back to manual entry if empty
- [x] Agent purpose preview shown before dialing
- [x] Wired to `POST /calls/outbound` via `initiateOutboundCall()`
- [x] "New Call" button added to Call Recordings page header; reloads call list on success

### Bugs Fixed (session 11)
- [x] `GET /settings/agent` used anon `supabase` client → RLS blocked reads → page showed "0 of 0 features" on refresh; switched to `supabase_admin`
- [x] `GET /settings/agent/audit-log` same RLS issue — switched to `supabase_admin`
- [x] `GET /settings/communication` same RLS issue — switched to `supabase_admin`
- [x] Calendar Appointment Details modal missing client phone + email display
- [x] Calendar Edit Appointment modal missing client phone + email fields; not saved on update
- [x] `release_phone_number()` did not delete outbound SIP trunk → orphaned `ST_htrEWVP2hm6P` in LiveKit after releasing +14159935287; fixed by adding outbound trunk cleanup to release flow
- [x] `LIVEKIT_SIP_OUTBOUND_TRUNK_ID` was a single shared env var (wrong for multi-tenant); moved to per-number `livekit_outbound_trunk_id` column in `business_phone_numbers`

### Bugs Fixed
- [x] `ai-employees-app/.env` — stray backtick on `VITE_VOICE_AGENT_API_URL` caused 404 on `/calls/initiate`
- [x] `user_services` RLS — staff could not select their own services; added policy `Users can manage their own service assignments` (migration `20260323000000_user_services_staff_rls.sql`)
- [x] `settings.py` `.maybeSingle()` AttributeError — Python supabase client has no `.maybeSingle()`; fixed to `.limit(1).execute()` + `result.data[0]`
- [x] `calls.py` `.maybeSingle()` AttributeError — same fix in `get_call`, `get_summary`, `get_recording`
- [x] `PUT /forwarding/contacts/bulk/toggle` 500 — FastAPI matched `"bulk"` as UUID param on `/{contact_id}/toggle`; fixed by moving `bulk/toggle` route above `/{contact_id}/toggle` in `forwarding.py`
- [x] `GET /settings/agent/state` 500 duplicate key — regular `supabase` client blocked by RLS returned empty → INSERT failed with unique constraint; fixed by switching SELECT to `supabase_admin` and changing INSERT to `.upsert(on_conflict="business_id")`

### Frontend (`ai-employees-app`)
- [x] React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + shadcn-ui + Tailwind
- [x] Supabase Auth with MFA/TOTP support
- [x] ProtectedRoute + role-based access (super_admin, admin, user)
- [x] Onboarding flow (2-step: business + location creation)
- [x] Select location screen (persisted in localStorage)
- [x] Dashboard layout with sidebar navigation
- [x] `/dashboard/customer-service` — voice agent UI: setup checklist, test call button, agent activity log
- [x] Customer Service module — 5-page nested layout with CS sub-sidebar (`CustomerServiceLayout`)
- [x] CS1 — Agent Performance dashboard: stat cards, call volume area chart, call distribution donut, response time bar chart, recent activity feed
- [x] CS2 — Call Recordings & Transcripts: searchable call list, transcript/summary/insights tabs, audio playback bar, chat-bubble transcript view
- [x] CS3 — AI Agent Scheduler: agent toggle, per-day schedule with time selectors, custom schedules, quick presets
- [x] CS4 — Call Forwarding: contact list with role/priority badges, forwarding rules, quick actions, today's stats
- [x] CS5 — AI Agent Settings: feature toggles grouped by category, configuration presets, recent changes
- [x] Reusable `StatCard` component (`components/ui/stat-card.tsx`)
- [x] Reusable `FeatureToggleRow` component (`components/ui/feature-toggle-row.tsx`)
- [x] Dashboard layout max-width constraint removed — all pages now use full available width
- [x] LiveKit client integration — Room(), mic enable, remote audio via Web Audio API
- [x] Brand voice wizard (5-step: tone, style, vocabulary, do-not-say, review)
- [x] Global settings page (language, region, date/time format)
- [x] Communication settings page UI (call/email/SMS scripts) — UI only, no DB save yet
- [x] Team management (invite, roles, permissions, location assignments)
- [x] `voiceAgentApi.ts` — `/calls/initiate`, `/calls/recent-activity`
- [x] **Calendar page** — fully implemented, month/week/day/list views, full CRUD (`Calendar.tsx`, 824 lines)
- [x] **Appointments** — `useAppointments.ts` full CRUD, saves to `appointments` table in Supabase
- [x] **Services** — `useServices.ts` full CRUD + `ServicesTab.tsx` UI, saves to `services` table
- [x] **Staff ↔ Services mapping** — `useUserServices.ts` full CRUD, saves to `user_services` table
- [x] **Staff working hours** — `useTeamMemberAvailability.ts` + `useUserAvailability.ts`, saves to `user_availability` table
- [x] **Staff time off / date overrides** — `user_availability_overrides` table, full CRUD + UI (TeamMemberHoursDialog, DateOverrideModal)

## 📋 TODO

### Agent — Appointment Update/Cancel Fixes ✅ DONE (session 7-8)

#### Step 1 — DB Schema
- [x] Migration `20260327000000_appointments_client_contact.sql`: add `client_email TEXT DEFAULT ''` column to `appointments`
- [x] Migration `20260327000000_appointments_client_contact.sql`: add `client_phone TEXT DEFAULT ''` column to `appointments`

#### Step 2 — book_appointment improvements
- [x] Store `client_email` in its own column when inserting appointment row
- [x] Store `client_phone` in its own column (removed from `notes`)
- [x] Made email collection required in agent instructions and as required `book_appointment` param

#### Step 3 — update_appointment fixes
- [x] Added `client_name` param — DB filters by name first (ilike), then Python prefix-matches ref on ≤50 rows
- [x] Added availability check: if rescheduling to an already-booked slot, returns error asking agent to check availability first
- [x] Send reschedule confirmation email to customer (reads `client_email` from DB row)
- [x] Send reschedule notification email to assigned staff member
- [x] Fixed UUID ILIKE bug — PostgREST doesn't support `id::text` cast in filter; reverted to Python-side prefix match with DB-level name filter

#### Step 4 — cancel_appointment fixes
- [x] Added `client_name` param — same efficient lookup as update_appointment
- [x] Send cancellation confirmation email to customer (reads `client_email` from DB row)
- [x] Send cancellation notification email to assigned staff member
- [x] **Soft delete** — cancel sets `status = 'cancelled'` instead of hard DELETE; row kept for analytics
- [x] Migration `20260327000001_appointments_status.sql`: add `status TEXT DEFAULT 'confirmed'` column
- [x] `find_appointments`, `update_appointment`, `cancel_appointment` lookups all filter `.neq("status", "cancelled")`
- [x] `_fetch_appointments_on_date` (availability check) also excludes cancelled rows
- [x] Frontend `useAppointments.ts` — added `.neq("status", "cancelled")` filter so cancelled appointments no longer show in Calendar

#### Note on existing appointments
- Old appointments (booked before migration) have `client_email = ''` so reschedule/cancel emails won't fire for them — expected. All new bookings will have it stored.

---

### Backend — Appointment & Service API Endpoints
These don't exist yet on the backend (frontend queries Supabase directly — backend is unaware):
- [ ] `GET/POST /appointments` — list + create
- [ ] `GET/PUT/DELETE /appointments/{id}` — detail, update, cancel
- [ ] `GET /appointments/availability` — available slots for a staff member on a date
- [ ] `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /services` — service CRUD
- [ ] `GET /services/{service_id}/staff` — staff who offer this service

### Backend — Business Authorization
- [ ] Add business_id authorization check — verify user has `user_roles` entry for requested `business_id` (currently trusts frontend)

### Communication Settings — Fix Frontend Save
- [ ] `CustomerServiceSettings.tsx` — "Save All Settings" button currently does nothing; wire up to `PUT /settings/communication` backend endpoint

### Phone / Twilio + LiveKit SIP Integration

**Architecture decision:** Twilio Elastic SIP Trunking (not TwiML webhooks).
- One shared Twilio SIP trunk for all businesses
- One LiveKit inbound SIP trunk (matches Twilio)
- One LiveKit dispatch rule **per phone number** → carries only `{business_id}` in attributes (location_id removed to avoid stale FK issues)
- Business context flows: dispatch rule metadata → agent `ctx.job.metadata` → same context loading as web calls
- Outbound: `CreateSIPParticipant` API (agent in room first, then dial customer in)

#### Step 0 — One-time Infrastructure Setup (done once by dev, not per business)
- [x] `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` + `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` added to `backend/.env` (fixed typo from TWILLIO → TWILIO)
- [x] `scripts/setup_sip_trunks.py` written — fully automated setup script:
  - Creates LiveKit inbound SIP trunk (Twilio → LiveKit, with IP allowlist + digest auth)
  - Creates LiveKit outbound SIP trunk (LiveKit → Twilio termination domain)
  - Creates Twilio Elastic SIP Trunk
  - Adds LiveKit SIP endpoint as origination URI on Twilio trunk
  - Creates Twilio credential list for outbound auth (LiveKit → Twilio)
  - Assigns credential list to Twilio trunk
  - Outputs all IDs + secrets ready to paste into `.env`
- [x] `backend/.env.example` updated with all new Twilio/SIP env var placeholders
- [x] **RUN `python scripts/setup_sip_trunks.py`** — all IDs filled in `backend/.env`

#### Step 1 — Database Migration
- [x] Migration file: `supabase/migrations/20260328000000_business_phone_numbers.sql`
  - `business_phone_numbers` table with all columns + indexes
  - RLS: members can SELECT their own business's numbers; only service role can write
- [x] **RUN migration in Supabase** — applied

#### Step 2 — Backend: Phone Number Service (`backend/app/services/phone_number_service.py`)
- [x] `search_available_numbers(area_code, country, limit)` — Twilio available numbers API
- [x] `provision_phone_number(business_id, location_id, phone_number)` — purchase Twilio number, create LiveKit dispatch rule, create/update outbound trunk, insert DB row
  - Bug fixed: removed `inbound_numbers=[phone_number]` from dispatch rule — trunk's `numbers` filter is sufficient; the extra filter caused calls to keep ringing without agent pickup
- [x] `release_phone_number(phone_number_id)` — delete dispatch rule, release Twilio number, soft-delete DB row
- [x] `get_phone_numbers_for_business(business_id)` — returns active numbers for a business

#### Step 3 — Backend: Phone Number API Routes (`backend/app/routers/phone_numbers.py`)
- [x] `GET /phone-numbers/search?area_code=415&country=US`
- [x] `POST /phone-numbers/provision` — body: `{phone_number, location_id?}`
- [x] `GET /phone-numbers` — list active numbers for authenticated business
- [x] `DELETE /phone-numbers/{id}` — release number
- [x] Router registered in `main.py`; Twilio vars added to `config.py`

#### Step 4 — Agent: SIP Inbound Context Reading + Call Record Creation
- [x] Source 1: `ctx.job.metadata` (dispatch rule attributes — primary for SIP)
- [x] Source 2: `participant.metadata` (backend token — web call path, unchanged)
- [x] Source 3: `participant.attributes` (SIP participant attrs from dispatch rule)
- [x] Source 4: DB lookup by `sip.trunkPhoneNumber` (last resort)
- [x] Detect `sip.callDirection` — `"inbound"` or `"outbound"`
- [x] Outbound calls use different `generate_reply()` opener (introduce self + purpose)
- [x] SIP call record auto-created at session start (so calls appear in website logs with transcript + summary)

#### Step 5 — Frontend: Phone Number Picker in Onboarding
- [x] `voiceAgentApi.ts` — added `searchPhoneNumbers`, `provisionPhoneNumber`, `getPhoneNumbers`, `releasePhoneNumber`
- [x] `PhoneNumberStep.tsx` — area code search, selectable results list, provision + "Skip for now"
- [x] `Onboarding.tsx` — 3-step flow: business → location → phone number
- [x] `useOnboarding.ts` — `createBusinessWithLocation` now returns `{business_id, location_id}`; added `finishOnboarding()` for navigation

#### Step 6 — Frontend: Phone Number Management Page
- [x] `PhoneNumbers.tsx` — `/dashboard/settings/phone-numbers`
  - Lists active numbers with Active badge + formatted display
  - Empty state with "Get a phone number" CTA
  - Inline number picker (area code search → select → provision)
  - Release button with AlertDialog confirmation
- [x] Route registered in `App.tsx`
- [x] "Phone Numbers" added to Sidebar under Settings (admin + super_admin)

#### Step 7 — Outbound Calls (follow-up / reminder calls)
- [x] `livekit_service.create_sip_participant()` — dials PSTN number into a LiveKit room via outbound SIP trunk
- [x] `POST /calls/outbound` — looks up business's from_number → create room → dispatch agent (outbound metadata) → SIP dial → DB record
- [x] `OutboundCallRequest` / `OutboundCallResponse` schemas added
- [x] `initiateOutboundCall()` added to `voiceAgentApi.ts`
- [x] Agent already handles `call_direction == "outbound"` opener (Step 4)
- [x] Frontend `OutboundCallDialog` — call type selection, filtered appointment list, auto-fill phone, purpose preview
- [x] **Outbound trunk architecture fix** — each number has its own outbound trunk stored in DB (not shared env var)
  - `livekit_outbound_trunk_id` column added to `business_phone_numbers` (migration `20260331000000_bpn_outbound_trunk.sql`)
  - `livekit_service.create_sip_participant()` now accepts explicit `outbound_trunk_id` param
  - `POST /calls/outbound` fetches trunk ID from DB alongside `from_number`
  - `provision_phone_number()` creates per-number outbound trunk + stores ID in DB
  - `release_phone_number()` now also deletes outbound trunk on release (fixes orphaned trunk bug)
  - `LIVEKIT_SIP_OUTBOUND_TRUNK_ID` removed from `config.py` and `.env`
- [x] **Manual steps needed for existing numbers:**
  - Run migration `20260331000000_bpn_outbound_trunk.sql` in Supabase (backfills `ST_WZ95dtKEntty` for +14157077538)
  - Delete orphaned trunk `ST_htrEWVP2hm6P` from LiveKit dashboard (from released +14159935287)
  - +14152555624 has no outbound trunk yet — provision via app or create manually in LiveKit
- [x] **Outbound calls tested end-to-end** — working (2026-04-02); fixed `livekit-api` upgrade 0.6→1.1 (`agent_dispatch` missing in 0.6)
- [ ] Wire up `missed_call_text_back` feature flag: on call end with `status=missed`, trigger outbound callback (future)

#### Step 8 — SMS via Twilio
- [x] `agent/sms_helpers.py` — `send_appointment_confirmation_sms`, `send_appointment_reminder_sms`, `send_missed_call_sms`
  - Reads `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` / `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` from env
  - Looks up business's provisioned `from` number from `business_phone_numbers` table
  - All functions are fire-and-forget (callers wrap in try/except)
- [x] `supabase_helpers._is_feature_enabled(supabase, business_id, feature_key)` — reads `agent_settings` table
- [x] `book_appointment` — sends confirmation SMS when `send_texts_during_after_calls` is enabled
- [x] `_finalize_call` — detects missed calls (inbound + empty transcript), marks status `missed`, sends text-back when `missed_call_text_back` is enabled
- [x] `agent/.env.local` — Twilio credentials added

### Google Calendar Integration
- [x] `google_calendar_tokens` table — `(staff_id, business_id, google_email, access_token, refresh_token, token_expiry)` with RLS
- [x] `google_event_id` column added to `appointments` table
- [x] Backend `google_calendar_service.py` — OAuth URL builder, token exchange, refresh, revoke, create/update/delete event
- [x] Backend `GET /integrations/google/auth-url` — returns OAuth consent URL
- [x] Backend `POST /integrations/google/callback` — exchanges code, saves tokens to DB
- [x] Backend `GET /integrations/google/status` — returns connected state + google_email
- [x] Backend `DELETE /integrations/google/disconnect` — revokes + deletes tokens
- [x] Backend config: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` settings
- [x] Frontend `Integrations.tsx` — fully wired: connect button → OAuth redirect, callback handling, disconnect, connected email shown
- [x] Frontend `voiceAgentApi.ts` — `getGoogleCalendarAuthUrl`, `completeGoogleCalendarOAuth`, `getGoogleCalendarStatus`, `disconnectGoogleCalendar`
- [x] Agent `book_appointment` — creates event on **both** staff calendar + superadmin calendar; stores `google_event_id` (staff) + `google_event_id_admin`
- [x] Agent `update_appointment` — PATCHes both staff + admin calendar events
- [x] Agent `cancel_appointment` — DELETEs both staff + admin calendar events before DB delete
- [x] Agent token auto-refresh — checks expiry before every API call, refreshes and updates DB
- [x] `google_event_id_admin` column added to `appointments` table (migration 20260319000001)
- [x] Account Settings — Google Calendar connect/disconnect section (all staff can connect their own calendar)
- [x] OAuth `return_to` flow — callback redirects back to the page that initiated OAuth (Integrations or Account Settings)
- [x] `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` added to `backend/.env`
- [ ] Customer confirmation: send `.ics` file via SMS or email on booking
- [ ] Super admin view: in-app calendar reads from `appointments` table across all staff (already partially done via Calendar.tsx)

### SMS Sending
- [ ] Choose provider: Twilio SMS (when available) or AWS SNS as alternative
- [ ] SMS service in backend (`backend/app/services/sms_service.py`)
- [ ] Send appointment confirmation SMS on booking
- [ ] Send reminder SMS N days before appointment (scheduler / cron job)
- [ ] Send missed-call text-back SMS (trigger on call end with status `missed`)
- [ ] Wire up `missed_call_text_back` and `send_texts_during_after_calls` feature flags to actual sending logic

### Email Sending — Gmail Integration
- [x] Gmail OAuth flow (business-level, one sending Gmail per business)
- [x] `gmail_tokens` table — business_id unique key, stores access/refresh tokens
- [x] `backend/app/services/email_service.py` — Gmail API send, token refresh, HTML template
- [x] `GET/POST /integrations/gmail/auth-url|callback|status|disconnect` — OAuth routes
- [x] `backend/app/core/config.py` — added `gmail_redirect_uri`
- [x] `agent/agent.py` — `_gmail_send_confirmation` helper; fires after `book_appointment` if client_email provided
- [x] `agent/agent.py` — `_gmail_send_staff_notification` helper; fires on every booking to assigned staff member (fetches staff email via `supabase.auth.admin.get_user_by_id`)
- [x] Agent collects required `client_email` in `book_appointment` tool (now a required parameter)
- [x] Frontend `voiceAgentApi.ts` — `getGmailAuthUrl`, `completeGmailOAuth`, `getGmailStatus`, `disconnectGmail`
- [x] Frontend `Integrations.tsx` — Gmail card fully wired (connect/disconnect/status badge)
- [x] `App.tsx` — `/integrations/gmail/callback` route added
- [ ] Add `.ics` calendar attachment to confirmation email
- [ ] Send reminder email N days before appointment (needs scheduler/cron)
- [ ] Wire up `confirmation_reminder_calls` feature flag to email trigger

### Support Page — Form Submission
- [ ] Wire "Submit Request" form on Support page to send to `support@aiemployeesinc.com` (set up email account first, then connect via Gmail API or SMTP)

### Frontend — Remaining Stubs
- [ ] Marketing Employee page
- [ ] Sales Employee page
- [ ] HR Employee page
- [ ] Executive Assistant page
- [ ] Billing page
- [x] Integrations page — Google Calendar OAuth fully wired (connect, callback, disconnect, status)
- [ ] Integrations page — wire up Twilio connection
- [ ] Setup checklist in `/dashboard/customer-service/setup` — sync state to backend (currently all mock/UI-only)
- [ ] CS pages — wire real data from backend/Supabase (call recordings, scheduler, forwarding contacts are currently mock data)

### CS Pages — API Wiring (frontend only, backend already exists)
- [x] **CS1 AgentPerformance** — replace mock stats with `GET /analytics/summary`
- [x] **CS1 AgentPerformance** — replace mock chart data with `GET /analytics/call-volume-trends?period=`
- [x] **CS1 AgentPerformance** — replace mock donut data with `GET /analytics/call-distribution`
- [x] **CS1 AgentPerformance** — replace mock activity feed with `GET /calls/recent-activity`
- [x] **CS2 CallRecordings** — replace mock call list with `GET /calls?business_id=&status=&direction=&search=&page=`
- [x] **CS2 CallRecordings** — load transcript on call select via `GET /calls/{id}/transcript`
- [x] **CS2 CallRecordings** — load summary + insights on call select via `GET /calls/{id}/summary`
- [x] **CS2 CallRecordings** — wire audio player to `GET /calls/{id}/recording` signed URL (shows "no recording" for test calls)
- [x] **CS3 Scheduler** — wire agent on/off toggle to `GET/PUT /settings/agent/state`
- [ ] **CS3 Scheduler** — new backend endpoint `GET/PUT /settings/agent/schedule` (backed by `business_hours` table) + wire frontend
- [x] **CS4 CallForwarding** — replace mock contacts with `GET /forwarding/contacts`
- [x] **CS4 CallForwarding** — wire toggle to `PUT /forwarding/contacts/{id}/toggle`
- [x] **CS4 CallForwarding** — wire delete to `DELETE /forwarding/contacts/{id}`
- [x] **CS4 CallForwarding** — wire Enable All / Disable All to `PUT /forwarding/contacts/bulk/toggle`
- [x] **CS4 CallForwarding** — replace mock rules with `GET /forwarding/rules`
- [x] **CS4 CallForwarding** — wire today's stats to `GET /analytics/summary` (`forwarded_calls`, `completed_calls`)
- [x] **CS4 CallForwarding** — Add Contact modal wired to `POST /forwarding/contacts`
- [x] **CS5 AgentSettings** — load feature flags from `GET /settings/agent` on mount
- [x] **CS5 AgentSettings** — wire Save Changes to `PUT /settings/agent`

- [x] **CS5 AgentSettings** — load recent changes from `GET /settings/agent/audit-log`
- [x] **CS5 AgentSettings** — wire agent on/off (Quick Actions) to `PUT /settings/agent/state`
- [x] Add all new API functions to `voiceAgentApi.ts`: analytics, calls list, forwarding CRUD, agent settings CRUD
- [x] `useDebounce` hook added (`src/hooks/useDebounce.ts`)

### Deployment
- [x] `ai-employees-app/Dockerfile` — multi-stage build: Node 20 Alpine (Vite build) → nginx Alpine (serve)
- [x] `ai-employees-app/nginx.conf` — SPA fallback, static asset caching, gzip
- [x] `ai-employees-app/docker-compose.yml` — single service, reads VITE_* vars from `.env` at build time
- [ ] HTTPS / domain setup — `getUserMedia` (mic) requires secure context; bare IP HTTP doesn't work in browsers

## 🗒️ Architecture Notes

### What exists in Supabase DB (frontend writes directly, backend doesn't expose yet):
- `appointments` — full CRUD via frontend
- `services` — full CRUD via frontend
- `user_services` — staff↔service mapping
- `user_availability` — weekly recurring working hours
- `user_availability_overrides` — time off / date exceptions
- `business_hours_overrides`, `location_hours_overrides` — also present

### Agent tool strategy:
- Agent reads Supabase directly (same as frontend does) — no backend API layer needed for reads
- Writes (create/update/cancel appointment) also go directly to Supabase from agent
- This keeps the architecture consistent with how the frontend works

### Key switch:
- `USE_LIVEKIT_AGENT=1` → new `agent/agent.py` (LiveKit Agents, auto-dispatched) — CURRENT
- `USE_LIVEKIT_AGENT=0` → legacy `backend/worker/voice_agent.py` (subprocess, writes transcripts) — BYPASSED

### Metadata flow:
- Backend encodes `{call_id, business_id, location_id}` in LiveKit token
- Agent reads it on room join via `participant.metadata`

### Frontend API base:
- `VITE_VOICE_AGENT_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:8003`)
