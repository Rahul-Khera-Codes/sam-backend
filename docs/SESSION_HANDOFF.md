# Session Handoff — 2026-06-08 (Session 47)

Read this at the start of every session. It captures the full current state so you can pick up immediately.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /home/lap-68/Documents/gt-rahul/sam-backend
docker compose up -d                        # start all services
docker logs -f sam-backend-sam-agent-1      # agent logs
docker compose restart sam-agent            # restart agent after code changes
```

Two repos:
- **Backend + Agent:** `/home/lap-68/Documents/gt-rahul/sam-backend`
- **Frontend:** `/home/lap-68/Documents/gt-rahul/ai-employees-app`

Always check `TODO.md` in sam-backend for full task status.

## Current Branch

- **sam-backend:** `main` — all work committed to main. No pending feature branches.
- **ai-employees-app:** `main` — all frontend work committed directly to main and live.

---

## System Status (2026-06-05)

### Working end-to-end ✅
- Inbound SIP call → agent answers → books appointment → transcript + summary → emails → shows in UI
- Agent is fully **location-scoped**: services, staff, hours, settings, KB all scoped to the called location
- Agent refuses cross-location bookings; provides other branch's PSTN phone number on request
- Outbound calls (reminder/follow-up) — working
- **Call Forwarding Option C** — SIP REFER live transfer via `forward_call(contact_id)` agent tool; checks available_start/available_end window; polite refusal if outside hours
- Calendar full CRUD
- Agent Settings feature flags — load + save with audit log
- Communication Settings — load + save
- Call Forwarding contacts + rules — full CRUD, agent reads rules verbally (Option B) + live transfer (Option C)
- Custom Schedules — create/edit/toggle/delete; agent applies active schedule to prompt
- Gmail OAuth per location — confirmation + cancellation + reschedule emails to customer + staff
- Google Calendar per staff — creates/updates/deletes events on booking/reschedule/cancel
- SMS — confirmation on booking, missed call text-back (Twilio)
- Phone Numbers page — search/provision/release US + **Canadian numbers** (CA added session 38)
- Team Management — invite by email (with custom role support), role assignment, location assignment
- **Roles & Permissions v2** — fully editable matrix; create/delete custom roles; permissions enforced on login via DB; custom roles assignable in invite dialog
- Business soft delete / deactivation — super_admin only, name confirmation, 90-day grace period
- Support page form — wired to `POST /support/submit`
- Integrations tab — Gmail OAuth wired; search bar filters all cards
- Business authorization enforced across all backend routers

### Also Working ✅ (added session 39–40)
- **Stripe Billing** — full integration: plan selection (Starter/Growth/Pro), Stripe Checkout redirect, Customer Portal for self-serve management, webhooks sync subscription state to DB, usage progress bar, period start/renewal dates shown
- **Booking validation guards** — `_validate_booking_datetime` in `supabase_helpers.py`; `get_available_slots` + `book_appointment` both reject past dates, closed days, out-of-hours times, custom schedule overrides, double-booking
- **TC-ROLES-002** — `togglePermission` now receives `roleId` explicitly from `selectedRole.id`; null-safety guard added
- **TC-TEAM-006** — AlertDialog confirmation before Remove User; `isRemoving` guard; Escape-key protection

### Blocked / Waiting
- **SMS 2FA** — blocked on client A2P 10DLC campaign approval
- **Resend DNS** — domain verification failed on Hostinger; email verification emails broken; re-add DKIM/SPF/DMARC in Hostinger DNS zone

## Architecture Overview

### Agent Context Resolution (priority order)
1. `ctx.job.metadata` — JSON `{business_id, location_id, call_id}` from LiveKit dispatch rule
2. `participant.metadata` — same JSON, set by backend token (web calls)
3. `participant.attributes` — SIP attrs, reads `business_id` + `location_id`
4. DB lookup by `sip.trunkPhoneNumber` in `business_phone_numbers` (last resort)

### Custom Roles & Permissions (shipped session 38)
- Tables: `custom_roles` (one per business per role), `role_page_permissions` (page-level access per role)
- 3 system roles seeded per business: Admin (super_admin), Manager (admin), Team Member (user)
- Admins can create named custom roles (e.g. "Receptionist") based on any base role
- Page permissions per role are editable in the Roles & Permissions UI
- `custom_role_id` column added to `user_roles` + `location_invitations` — users can be assigned a specific custom role
- `useRolePermissions` hook: if user has `custom_role_id`, loads that role's permissions; else loads system role by base_role
- Backend: `sam-backend/backend/app/routers/roles.py` + `schemas/roles.py`
- Frontend enforcement: `ProtectedRoute` waits for `permissionsLoading`; `Sidebar` filters by `canAccess(path)`

### Key Backend Patterns
- All Supabase reads use `supabase_admin` (service role) to bypass RLS
- `verify_business_access(user_id, business_id)` — enforced on all routers
- `require_business_access()` — FastAPI dependency factory for query/path param endpoints
- Resource-ID endpoints use helper functions to look up resource's `business_id` and verify
- Settings endpoints use SELECT + INSERT/UPDATE pattern (not upsert) for partial unique index compatibility

### Phone Number / SIP Architecture
- One shared Twilio Elastic SIP trunk for all businesses
- One LiveKit inbound SIP trunk (matches Twilio)
- One LiveKit **dispatch rule per phone number** — carries `{business_id, location_id}` in metadata
- `business_phone_numbers` table: `business_id`, `location_id`, `phone_number`, `livekit_inbound_trunk_id`, `livekit_outbound_trunk_id`, `livekit_dispatch_rule_id`, `is_active`, `released_at`
- **US + CA numbers** — frontend has country selector (US/CA), backend passes to Twilio `available_phone_numbers(country)`

## What Was Done This Session (Session 47, 2026-06-08)

**Gmail document sending broken — diagnosed and fixed. OAuth credential hardening across all Google integrations.**

### Root cause: agent had wrong Google OAuth credentials
- `agent/.env.local` still had the OLD Google Cloud project (`902808969705`) and a truncated `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-` (cut off at the dash)
- Backend was updated to the new project (`870924190939`) when Sam switched OAuth apps
- Every Gmail token refresh attempt by the agent failed with `401 invalid_client` — silently, with no log
- Fix: updated `agent/.env.local` GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID + GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET to match `backend/.env`

### Fixes committed (4 commits, all on main)
1. **`agent/gmail_helpers.py`** — added `logger.warning` on token refresh failure so the exact Google error (`invalid_client`, `token_revoked`, etc.) is now visible in logs
2. **`agent/gcal_helpers.py`** — same silent-failure fix; also fixed null `token_expiry` being skipped (was returning stale token instead of refreshing)
3. **`agent/gmail_helpers.py`** — null `token_expiry` now treated as expired → triggers refresh (matches backend pattern)
4. **`backend/email_service.py` + `backend/google_calendar_service.py`** — log response body before `raise_for_status()` so the Google error detail isn't lost

### Key lesson
When switching Google Cloud projects: update BOTH `backend/.env` AND `agent/.env.local` — they are separate credential stores. The backend creates OAuth tokens; the agent refreshes them. Mismatched credentials = silent hourly failure.

### Current state
- Document sending working ✅ (confirmed by Sam)
- All 4 Google OAuth token refresh paths now log exact error on failure
- `agent/.env.local` GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET = matches backend (not committed — env file is gitignored)

## What Was Done This Session (Session 46, 2026-06-05)

**Client issue review session. 12 items fixed across both repos.**

### sam-backend (`feature/available-slots-tools`)
- **Booking confirmation spelling** — Agent reads phone back digit-by-digit and email letter-by-letter before calling `book_appointment`. `prompt_builder.py` step 6.
- **Agent farewell** — After booking/reschedule/cancel, agent asks "Is there anything else I can help you with?" then closes with "Thank you for calling and have a great day!" `prompt_builder.py`.
- **PDF document library** — `backend/app/routers/documents.py` + `schemas/documents.py`: `POST/GET/DELETE /documents`. Supabase Storage bucket `business-documents`. Agent `email_document` tool preloads docs at call start, sends PDF via Gmail attachment. `send_email_with_attachment()` in `email_service.py`. `_fetch_documents_for_location()` in `supabase_helpers.py`. `_format_documents()` in `prompt_builder.py`.
- **Working rules in CLAUDE.md** — Ask first, web search packages, disagree openly, trace before fixing.

### ai-employees-app (`main`)
- **Call Forwarding toggle** — `AgentSettings.tsx`: toggle now calls `bulkToggleForwardingContacts`. Commit `d5a59b0` (earlier session, same branch).
- **Team Management "Unknown User" RLS** — Migration `20260522000001_profiles_team_visibility.sql`: business members can now read each other's profiles. Sam's profile row created directly (was missing — admin-created user bypasses trigger).
- **Knowledge Base inline edit** — Pencil icon + inline textarea + Save/Cancel per text entry. `BusinessSettings.tsx`.
- **Login text** — "Don't you have an account?" → "Don't have an account yet?".
- **Calendar date off-by-one** — `new Date(e.target.value)` → `parseISO()` in both date inputs. Fixes UTC-negative timezone shift (Canada).
- **Date picker click area** — `showPicker()` on click on all 4 date inputs. Picker opens anywhere on field.
- **No-Show Follow-Up label** — "Days before appointment to call" → "Days after appointment to call".
- **CLAUDE.md created** — `ai-employees-app` now has its own CLAUDE.md with working rules.

### Data fixes (direct DB)
- `sam@aiemployeesinc.com` (`1bc53b7c...`) had no `profiles` row — created it with service role. Team Management now shows "sam" instead of "Unknown User".

### Pending — awaiting client decision
- **Team Management #18** — Unassigned appointments + block user removal until reassigned. Client choice: Option A (warn + block) or Option B (inline reassign). Drafted message in Google Doc.

### Not bugs (confirmed working)
- Profile Settings issues — working correctly on live site
- Calendar date format difference — browser/OS locale rendering, not a code issue
- Agent can't send PDF — client's Gmail not connected; documents DO exist in DB (`f82203e7` business)

---

## What Was Done This Session (Session 45, 2026-05-28)

**Production fixes session. No code changes. Server `.env` fixes, Stripe webhook setup, Google OAuth debugging, docs written for Sam.**

### Fix 1: Gmail OAuth redirect URI mismatch
- Server `backend/.env` had `GMAIL_REDIRECT_URL` (wrong name) + `GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI=${GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI}` (self-reference, resolved to empty)
- Fixed to: `GMAIL_REDIRECT_URI=https://portal.aiemployeesinc.com/integrations/gmail/callback`
- `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` was already correct on server
- `BILLING_SUCCESS_URL` / `BILLING_CANCEL_URL` fixed from `api.aiemployeesinc.com` → `portal.aiemployeesinc.com`

### Fix 2: Stripe webhook
- Webhook endpoint was not configured in Stripe dashboard
- Added `https://api.aiemployeesinc.com/billing/webhook` with all 5 required events:
  `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`
- Billing subscription now shows correctly after checkout ✅

### Fix 3: Google OAuth app published
- Sam's new Google Cloud OAuth app for integrations was in Testing mode
- Told Sam to publish it: OAuth consent screen → Publish App → Confirm

### Doc: Google OAuth setup guide for Sam
- Written at `docs/GOOGLE_OAUTH_SETUP.md`
- Covers: creating Google Cloud project, enabling Gmail + Calendar APIs, OAuth consent screen, credentials, redirect URIs, sending creds to Rahul

### Diagnosed: Google login "Unable to exchange external code" error
- Error: `Unable to exchange external code: 4/0A` on `/pending-invitations`
- Root cause: Supabase Auth Google OAuth client in Google Cloud Console is missing `https://hdnwxonrwcnaodjxipll.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` in authorized redirect URIs
- Likely happened when Sam was setting up his new Google Cloud project today and accidentally modified the existing one
- **Fix (Sam's action):** Add `https://hdnwxonrwcnaodjxipll.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback` to the OAuth client used by Supabase Auth in Google Cloud Console
- Email delivery confirmed working (forgot password email received) — SMTP not the issue

### Confirmed: Two separate Google OAuth setups
- Supabase Auth Google provider: its own credentials, not ours — controls "Sign in with Google"
- `backend/.env` GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET: currently Rahul's, to be replaced by Sam's — controls Gmail + Calendar integrations

---

## What Was Done Previous Session (Session 44, 2026-05-21)

### Feature 1: Custom Greeting Message for Inbound Calling (sam-backend + ai-employees-app)

- `agent/prompt_builder.py` — `custom_greeting: str | None = None` param added to `build_instructions`. When set, replaces the hardcoded welcome block with `Start the call with this greeting: "..."`. Whitespace-only treated as unset. 4 tests in `agent/tests/test_prompt_builder.py`.
- `agent/agent.py` — reads `inbound_calling.config_value.greeting_message` before calling `build_instructions`, passes as `custom_greeting`.
- `AgentSettings.tsx` — pencil icon on Inbound Calling row → Custom Greeting Message dialog. Saves to `config_value.greeting_message`. Clears to null reverts to default.

### Feature 2: Appointment Status Buttons — Checked In / No Show / Cancelled (sam-backend + ai-employees-app)

- **DB migration** `20260521000000_appointments_noshow_called_at.sql` — `noshow_called_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NULL` added (applied, TS types regenerated).
- `backend/app/schemas/appointments.py` — `VALID_APPOINTMENT_STATUSES` set + `UpdateAppointmentStatusRequest` schema.
- `backend/app/routers/appointments.py` — `PATCH /appointments/{id}/status` lightweight endpoint (no GCal/email pipeline). Auth-guarded, validates status value.
- `backend/app/services/scheduler_service.py` — `run_noshow_calls()` added. Queries `status=no_show AND noshow_called_at IS NULL AND appointment_date = today - N days`. Registered in `start_scheduler()` on 1h interval. Reads `noshow_followup` config for days + template.
- `voiceAgentApi.ts` — `updateAppointmentStatus()` function. PATCH with `business_id` in body.
- `Calendar.tsx` — `status` field added to `AppointmentForm`. 3 status buttons (green/amber/red) at top of Edit dialog. Click saves immediately + closes modal. Label "— saves immediately" added to avoid confusion with Save Changes button.

### UI Fixes

- **CS Scheduler** — Regular Hours green box removed from sidebar (`CustomScheduleSidebar.tsx`)
- **Edit Appointment dialog** — `max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto` — no longer overflows screen
- **Inbound Calling ↔ Quick Agent Control sync** — toggling either one now updates both `agent_state.is_active` AND `agent_settings.inbound_calling.is_enabled`

### sam-backend commits (feature/available-slots-tools)
`42511cb` → `49e4ccd` → `1a796c2` → `97f61e3` → `cae15c7` → `11dfa61`

### ai-employees-app commits (main)
`9086e87` → `5b58a46` → `c9f1738` → `dcd0a09` → `e486bcd` → `5f3c7c0` → `7cf1515` → `2c88063` → `a745475` → `8660ff5` → `b2278f2`

### Still Pending
- **Merge `feature/available-slots-tools` → main** (sam-backend) — 28 tests passing, ready.
- **Deploy to Hostinger VPS** — Sam confirmed urgent (competitors in Canada). Not started.
- **Scheduler sync caveat** — `handleAgentToggle` in Scheduler.tsx sends `config_value: {}` when syncing inbound_calling, which overwrites any saved custom greeting. Fix: fetch existing config_value before sending update.

## What Was Done Previous Session (Session 42, 2026-05-14)

**Billing section fixed. Appointment pipeline built, tested, and working end-to-end.**

1. **Billing section fixes** (`feature/billing-section`, both repos) — 5 commits:
   - Pro/Professional naming mismatch fixed
   - `.env.example` Stripe var names corrected
   - Billing metric switched from call count to minutes (PLAN_KEY_MAP limits 200/600/1500/4000)
   - Supabase row cap guard added to `_count_minutes_in_period`
   - Unused `call_limit` variable renamed
   - All verified: 8 backend logic tests + TypeScript clean

2. **Appointment booking pipeline** (`feature/appointment-pipeline`, both repos) — tested live in Docker, working end-to-end:
   - `backend/app/schemas/appointments.py` — 4 Pydantic schemas
   - `backend/app/services/email_service.py` — 5 new email helpers
   - `backend/app/services/booking_service.py` — full pipeline: validation (hours + custom schedules + double-booking), DB insert/update/soft-cancel, GCal (staff+admin), Gmail (customer+staff), SMS
   - `backend/app/routers/appointments.py` — `POST/PUT/DELETE /appointments`
   - `ai-employees-app/src/lib/voiceAgentApi.ts` + `useAppointments.ts` — wired to backend
   - **Bugs fixed during live testing:** `.single()` AttributeError on insert, `duration: null` 422, `Number("30 min")` = NaN, 12h→24h time conversion, `full_name` column doesn't exist in profiles, GCal 403 (Google Calendar API not enabled in GCP — user fixed), silent GCal failures now logged
   - `feature/appointment-pipeline` is **stacked on `feature/billing-section`** — merge billing-section first

3. **Client comms logged** — Sam reported AI Scheduler vs Business Hours confusion. Root cause confirmed: both use same `business_hours` table. Awaiting demo videos.

4. **Confirmed merged branches** — feature/strip-integration, feature/custom-roles-v2, feature/location-scoped-architecture all 0 commits ahead of main.

5. **DEV_TRACKING.md** created at `docs/DEV_TRACKING.md` explaining the full session tracking system.

## What Was Done Previous Session (Session 42 earlier, 2026-05-12)

**Code review of `feature/billing-section` branch (both repos). 3 critical issues found — not ready to merge.**

1. **Branch reviewed** — `feature/billing-section` exists in both repos (sam-backend: 1 commit, ai-employees-app: 1 commit)
2. **Backend changes** — `billing.py` PLAN_KEY_MAP adds Enterprise tier (key `enterprise`, limit 1300, display "Enterprise"); `config.py` adds `stripe_enterprise_price_id`
3. **Frontend changes** — `Billing.tsx` fully rewritten: old 3-card grid replaced with 5-column comparison table (Free Trial / Starter / Growth / Professional / Enterprise) with 13 feature rows
4. **Critical issues found (must fix before merge):**
   - **Pro vs Professional name mismatch** — frontend sends `plan: "pro"` for Professional column; backend display name is "Pro"; subscribed users will see "Pro Plan" not "Professional Plan"
   - **`.env.example` wrong variable names** — `STRIPE_STARTER_PLAN_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_STARTER_PLAN_GROWTH_ID`, `STRIPE_STARTER_PLAN_PRO_ID` don't match what Pydantic reads (`STRIPE_STARTER_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_GROWTH_PRICE_ID`, `STRIPE_PRO_PRICE_ID`); `STRIPE_ENTERPRISE_PRICE_ID` is correct
   - **Billing metric mismatch** — backend counts call rows; client spec is minutes-based (200/600/1500/4000 min); PLAN_KEY_MAP limits still use old call counts (150/400/800/1300); active subscription panel shows "calls/month" not "minutes/month"
5. **What's good** — table renders correctly, Free Trial button properly disabled, per-column spinner works, webhook handlers intact, Enterprise wired correctly end-to-end
6. **Next:** fix the 3 critical issues, then merge

---

## What Was Done Previous Session (Session 40, 2026-05-01)

**TC-ROLES-002 + TC-TEAM-006 fixed; booking validation layer added; Stripe billing URLs/config documented.**

1. **TC-TEAM-006 fixed** — `TeamManagement.tsx`: AlertDialog confirmation before Remove User fires; `isRemoving` loading guard prevents double-click; `onOpenChange` guards against Escape-key dismiss mid-request. Commits: `943b35b`, `f0a58a3`, `5f13a80`

2. **TC-ROLES-002 fixed** — `RolesPermissions.tsx`: `togglePermission` now accepts `roleId: string` as explicit first param; call site passes `selectedRole.id`; `isAdminUser && selectedRole` null guard added. Commits: `b2c04db`, `81305dd`

3. **Booking validation** — `agent/supabase_helpers.py`: `_validate_booking_datetime()` rejects past dates, closed days, out-of-hours times, custom schedule overrides; `get_available_slots` and `book_appointment` in `agent.py` both guarded; double-booking check in `book_appointment`. 11 unit tests in `agent/tests/test_booking_validation.py`.

4. **Resend DNS issue identified** — `aiemployeesinc.com` domain verification failed in Resend (likely Hostinger DNS records dropped). Email verification emails are broken. Fix: re-add DKIM/SPF/DMARC in Hostinger DNS zone.

5. **Billing URLs** — need to update `BILLING_SUCCESS_URL` + `BILLING_CANCEL_URL` in `backend/.env` on server to `http://116.202.210.102:20252/...` before merging.

6. **All work on `feature/strip-integration`** — not yet merged to main. Ready to merge once billing URLs updated and DNS fixed.

## What Was Done Previous Session (Session 39, 2026-04-30)

**Full Stripe billing integration built end-to-end and verified working in browser.**

1. **Stripe billing router** — `sam-backend/backend/app/routers/billing.py` (new)
   - `GET /billing/subscription` — returns plan name, status, call usage, period dates
   - `POST /billing/create-checkout-session` — creates Stripe Checkout session, returns redirect URL
   - `POST /billing/customer-portal` — creates Stripe Customer Portal session, returns redirect URL
   - `POST /billing/webhook` — handles `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.created/updated/deleted`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, `invoice.payment_failed`
   - `_attr()` helper for safe StripeObject/dict field access (Stripe SDK v15 uses attribute access, not `.get()`)
   - Period dates read from `sub.items.data[0]` (Stripe 2026 API moved them from subscription root)

2. **Billing schemas** — `sam-backend/backend/app/schemas/billing.py` (new)
   - `SubscriptionResponse`, `CreateCheckoutSessionRequest`, `CreateCheckoutSessionResponse`, `CustomerPortalResponse`

3. **Config** — `sam-backend/backend/app/core/config.py` — added 7 Stripe fields including price IDs for 3 plans

4. **Migration** — `ai-employees-app/supabase/migrations/20260430000001_businesses_stripe.sql` — 7 Stripe columns on `businesses` table (**not yet applied to Supabase — apply before launch**)

5. **TypeScript types** — `ai-employees-app/src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` — 7 Stripe fields added to businesses Row/Insert/Update

6. **Frontend API** — `ai-employees-app/src/lib/voiceAgentApi.ts` — `getBillingSubscription`, `createCheckoutSession`, `createCustomerPortalSession` functions

7. **Billing.tsx** — `ai-employees-app/src/pages/dashboard/Billing.tsx` — fully rewritten; shows plan cards (no sub) or usage progress + plan card (active sub); "Manage Plan" opens Stripe Customer Portal

8. **Bugs fixed during session:**
   - 503 on checkout: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` missing from backend `.env`; `STRIPE_PRICE_PRICE_ID` typo
   - 500 on webhooks: `AttributeError: get` — Stripe SDK StripeObjects don't support `.get()` → fixed with `_attr()` helper
   - 404 on success redirect: URL was `/dashboard/billing` but route is `/dashboard/settings/billing`
   - Period dates showing `—`: Stripe 2026 API moved `current_period_start/end` to `sub.items.data[0]`; DB patched directly + code fixed

9. **All verified live in browser** — subscription active, Starter plan shown, 0/150 calls, correct period start/renewal dates

## What Was Done This Session (38)

1. **Custom Roles & Permissions v2 — fully shipped** (continued from session 37)
   - Post-review fixes applied: `ProtectedRoute` now waits for `permissionsLoading`; `fetchRoles` stale closure fixed; `isAdminUser` aligned with backend (allows both super_admin and admin)
   - Custom roles in invite dialog: `TeamManagement` loads custom roles via API; non-system custom roles appear in invite dropdown; selecting a custom role sets both `base_role` + `customRoleId` in the invite
   - Migration `20260428000003`: added `custom_role_id` to `user_roles` + `location_invitations`
   - Edge functions updated: `invite-location-admin` + `accept-invitation` both store/read `customRoleId`
   - `useRolePermissions` hook: accepts `customRoleId` param — if set, looks up that role directly; else finds system role by base_role
   - `AuthContext`: threads `roles[0].custom_role_id` to `useRolePermissions`
   - Supabase generated types patched for both tables

2. **Canadian phone numbers** — added 🇺🇸/🇨🇦 country selector to PhoneNumbers page; switching resets results; placeholder text updates; backend already supported `country` param; verified working (Toronto 647 numbers shown)

3. **Client launch checklist saved to memory** — full checklist with ✅/⚠️/❌ status; only hard blocker remaining is Billing (no Stripe)

## What Was Done This Session (37)

1. **Pre-release checklist fixes — fully shipped**
   - Migration `20260428000000`: `available_start`/`available_end` on `forwarding_contacts`
   - Backend schemas updated; frontend UI time pickers added; agent enforces time window before SIP REFER
   - Setup checklist: `CustomerServiceEmployee.tsx` driven by real API data with click-to-navigate
   - 3 spec compliance fixes: forwarding contact types, Gmail status field name

2. **Automated test pass** — backend schemas, agent helpers, TypeScript, DB round-trip, auth enforcement all verified
